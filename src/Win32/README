			Building GNU-Prolog Win32 Setup
			-------------------------------

Auto-extract installation files are created with Inno Setup (version > 5.0). 
Refer to http://www.jrsoftware.org/ for more information. 

Note: this works under cygwin or MSYS. Under MSYS it is necessary to first
create the distrib under cygwin using make dist (because mingw does not
support links). Then simply do (under mingw) make setup (setup-link will NOT
work).



1) Building a setup classically
-------------------------------

To build a setup for GNU-Prolog:

   make setup

The stages executed are:

   1- build a distribution file (gprolog-VERSION.tar.gz) if needed using 
      'make dist' in the src (parent) directory.

   2- copy it under the /tmp

   3- uncompres it

   4- configure

   5- compile locally

   6- install it in /tmp/gprolog_win32

   7- build the setup auto-extract file

The setup file is created in /tmp and called setup-gprolog-VERSION.exe



2) Building a setup fastly 
--------------------------

If you have locally compiled GNU-Prolog (using './configure' followed by
'make' in the src (parent) directory) you can avoid stages 1, 2, 3, and 5
described above using:

   make setup-link

This will do a ./configure in src (parent) directory to specify
/tmp/gprolog_win32 as install dir, then make and make install. The setup file
is created similarly.
