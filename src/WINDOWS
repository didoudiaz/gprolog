		Windows compilation/installation instructions
		---------------------------------------------

This file describes how to compile GNU Prolog on recent Windows OS (64 bits).

NB: it is a good idea to activate Windows 11 developper mode.

NB: previsouly, this information was split into 2 files which are yet present but
renamed (consult them if needed) :

   WINDOWS -> WINDOWS-OLD (32 bits)
   WINDOWS64 -> WINDOWS64-OLD (64 bits)

We use here the msys/mingw64 environment to provide the unix tools (autoconf,
make, ...) required to compile GNU Prolog. This can be easily adapted to other
environments like cygwin, cygwin64 or WSL (Windows Subsytem Linux).

Under windows, 2 main compilers are available: gcc (using the mingw64 port) or
Microsoft Visual C++ (aka MSVC++). For both systems, we describe how to produce
a 32 or 64 bits version of GNU Prolog.

NB: this version of GNU Prolog DOES NOT accept spaces in pathnames.
Do not uncompress your source distribution under a pathname containing spaces.
Do not install it under a pathname containing spaces.


Installing and configuring MSYS2
--------------------------------

MSYS (www.msys2.org) provides a unix-like environment. Get MSYS2
(https://www.msys2.org) and install it (in C:\msys64 which will be the
root / of the msys filesystem).

MSYS consists of several environments:
   msys        POSIX emulation (unix/cygwin) /usr/bin      using msys-2.0.dll
   mingw32     32-bits i686   gcc toolchain  /mingw32/bin  using msvcrt.dll
   mingw64     64-bits x86_64 gcc toolchain  /mingw64/bin  using msvcrt.dll
   ucrt64      64-bits x86_64 gcc toolchain  /ucrt64/bin   using ucrt dlls
   clang64     POSIX emulation + clang /clang64/bin  using msys-2.0.dll
   clangarm64  ?

Setting PATH correctly can give priority to some binaries.

Refer to https://www.msys2.org/wiki/Porting/ to know which C macros are
predefined depending on the environment.

From the Windows Start Menu, the sub-menu MSYS2 provides 6 launchers
(which differ on how they initialize PATH variable - see above).
More info on launchers: https://www.msys2.org/wiki/Launchers/

Launch one et then update MSYS packages:

pacman -Syu

Install the following packages:

# Unix-like command-line tools
pacman -S base-devel
# to compile under msys (cygwin-based gcc)
pacman -S gcc
# to compile under mingw32
pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-toolchain
# to compile under mingw64
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain
# to compile under ucrt64
pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-toolchain
pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gdb
# to compile with clang, open a clang64 environment and then:
pacman -S mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-clang
   # then configure gprolog with: CC=clang ./configure (BEWARE: NOT TESTED)


# no longer needed (we use as instead of yasm)
# pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-yasm
# pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-yasm
# cp /mingw64/bin/yasm.exe /mingw64/bin/yasm-win64.exe

You can check gcc's configuration with
gcc -v --version

The MSYS entries in the Windows Start Menu correspond to shortcuts created in the
user'start menu directory, e.g. in the Windows user's home in
AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\MSYS2.
Each shortcut executes a binary in C:\msys64 whose role is to install a shell type:
msys2.exe, mingw32.exe, mingw64.exe, ucrt64.exe, clang64.exe, clangarm64.exe.

To launch a shell inside a terminal, it is also possible to execute
C:\msys64\msys2_shell.cmd with options (use -help for more info ):
  -msys | -mingw32 | -mingw64 | -ucrt64 | -clang64 | -clangarm64  set above shell type
  -defterm | -mintty | -conemu     Set terminal type (defterm = cmd.exe)
 
The PATH variable is passed to bash which cleans it to only keep some important
Windows paths (to keep it unmodified pass -full-path or set MSYS2_PATH_TYPE=inherit).
Other windows variable are passed to bash (e.g. HOME).
Msys bash is controlled via some important env. variables:

   MSYSTEM=MSYS or MINGW32 or MINGW64 or UCRT64...
   E.g. with MINGW64 bash adds /mingw64/bin before usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin.

   MSYS2_PATH_TYPE=inherit to keep the full Windows PATH inside bash.

   CHERE_INVOKING=1 define to stay in current directory
   (do not change to HOME directory).

NB: the default terminal emulation (mintty) is designed for POSIX and does not
work well to run native Windows console applications. Compiling GNU Prolog under
mintty is OK but the execution of gprolog.exe has some troubles (this is not
specific to gprolog and also occurs with gdb, the problem comes when launching a
win32 console application under mintty, see github.com/mintty/mintty/issues/56).
Here are alternatives (I personnaly use ConEmu - see alternative 3)

alternative 1: use msys2_shell.cmd with another terminal (see --help), e.g.
   msys2_shell.cmd -mingw64 -defterm
   msys2_shell.cmd -mingw64 -conemu (needs ConEmu installed - see below)
   It is possible to modify the shortcuts in user' start menu directly.
   Use -mingw32 or -msys to run other sub-systems.

alternative 2: execute the following command from a Windows cmd terminal:
   set MSYSTEM=MINGW64& C:\msys64\usr\bin\bash.exe --login -i
   NB: do not put a space before the & (else a trailing space will be added to
   the MSYSTEM environment variable).
   Use MSYS or MINGW32 for other sub-systems.

alternative 3: install and use ConEmu (conemu.github.io):
   See https://superuser.com/questions/1024301/conemu-how-to-call-msys2-as-tab/1297072#1297072
   define new tasks to start conEmu+bash with path on msys/mingw32/mingw64,.. e.g.:
   
   task {DD::msys}
   set MSYSTEM=MSYS    & "c:\msys64\usr\bin\bash.exe" --login -i "-new_console:C:\msys64\msys2.ico"

   task {DD::mingw32}
   set MSYSTEM=MINGW32 & "c:\msys64\usr\bin\bash.exe" --login -i "-new_console:C:\msys64\mingw32.ico"   

   task {DD::mingw64}
   set MSYSTEM=MINGW64 & "c:\msys64\usr\bin\bash.exe" --login -i "-new_console:C:\msys64\mingw64.ico"

   task {DD::ucrt64}
   set MSYSTEM=UCRT64 & "c:\msys64\usr\bin\bash.exe" --login -i "-new_console:C:\msys64\ucrt64.ico"

   task {DD::clang64}
   set MSYSTEM=CLANG64 & "c:\msys64\usr\bin\bash.exe" --login -i "-new_console:C:\msys64\clang64.ico"


Compiling GNU Prolog with gcc
-----------------------------

Launch a MSYS2 bash and follow the classical installation procedure (see ../INSTALL file), i.e.:

	./configure
	make
	make install

The default gcc will be used.


Compiling GNU Prolog with MSVC
------------------------------

You need MSVC++. GNU Prolog has been tested with Microsoft Visual
Studio 2022 Community v17.14.17 and the Microsoft SDK (including
Htmlhelp includes and library):
https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/fr/vs/community/

Once installed, you have to launch msys with the correct PATH, INCLUDE, LIB
environment variables. There are two .bat files provided with the MS compiler
e.g. vcvars32.bat and vcvars64.bat. Launch the appropriate .bat before lauching msys bash.
Under ConEmu you can modify the tasks (described above) to include the call to
vcvars32/64.bat as follows (NB: <Tomorrow> is a theme - can be omitted):

task {DD::mingw32}
set MSYSTEM=MINGW32 & set MSYS2_PATH_TYPE=inherit & call "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars32.bat" & "c:\msys64\usr\bin\bash.exe" --login -i "-new_console:C:\msys64\mingw32.ico" "-new_console:P:^<Tomorrow^>"

task {DD::mingw64}
set MSYSTEM=MINGW64 & set MSYS2_PATH_TYPE=inherit & call "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat" & "c:\msys64\usr\bin\bash.exe" --login -i "-new_console:C:\msys64\mingw64.ico" "-new_console:P:^<Tomorrow^>"

You can also create a third task to only compile wyth msys (POSIX emulation with gcc in /usr/bin/gcc):

task {DD::msys}
set MSYSTEM=MSYS & "c:\msys64\usr\bin\bash.exe" --login -i "-new_console:C:\msys64\msys2.ico" "-new_console:P:^<Tomorrow^>"

NB: msys provides a /bin/link.exe command which can shadow the Microsoft
linker (also called link.exe). If you encounter problem the simplest way to
solve it is to rename /bin/link.exe of cygwin.

Finally, you need the MinGW assembler (called as.exe). Copy it under a
directory inside your PATH (for instance in /bin) under the name mingw-as.exe.
A version can be found at: http://gprolog.org/mingw-as.exe
For the 64 bit version you need the YASM assembler (called yasm.exe). Copy it under a
directory inside your PATH (for instance in /bin) under the name yasm-win64.exe.
A version can be found at: http://gprolog.org/yasm-win64.exe

Once MSVC++ and the SDK are well installed use --with-msvc at configure time:

	./configure --with-msvc
	make
	make install

By default, the GUI console is compiled (sources in W32GUICons) unless you
use ./configure --disable-gui-console. See the ../INSTALL file for further
information. Even if compiled with the GUI it is possible to avoid it (and
run in console mode) a Prolog program setting the environment variable
LINEDIT to a string containing gui=no, e.g. 

bash:
   export LINEDIT='gui=no', 
windows:
   SET LINEDIT=gui=no.


Using Windows Emacs
-------------------

Install it with:
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-emacs

Binaries: c:/msys64/mingw64/bin/emacs.exe and runemacs.exe (dor double-clic)

The executables to run are in c:/msys64/mingw64/bin:
   runemacs.exe (to double-click, ie. close the console)
   emacs.exe (to use from a shell)

Define your HOME environment variable in Windows parameters (e.g c:\msys64\home\diaz).
For more info: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Windows-HOME.html
Then create your .emacs file in your HOME directory

To have an icon on the desktop and/or task-bar
   create a shortcut on the desktop (right-clic|New|Shortcut select runemacs.exe)
   right-clic on the shortuct and modify the starting directory (set your home)
   drag and drop the icon in the task-bar


Installing git for windows
--------------------------

There is no official git for msys (only a cygwin version which is both
slow and has problems with paths). Install from:
https://git-scm.com/downloads/win

add this to your .bashrc file
PATH=$PATH:'/c/Program Files/Git/cmd'

Under Windows the gprolog local repo should ignore file modes (else
git status will report a lot of not really modified files). In the
repo use (already included in src/SETVARS and src/DOSSETVARS.bat):

git config core.filemode false


Installing Inno Setup
---------------------

https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php

Current version installs in C:\Program Files (x86)\Inno Setup 6.

add this to your .bashrc file
PATH=$PATH:'/c/Program Files (x86)/Inno Setup 6/'

See README in Win32 to create a windows installer using Inno Setup


Using Microsoft HTML Help
-------------------------

With recent environments, nothing is needed to compile with Html Help,
(you can skip this section). This is the case with recent MS Visual Studio and
with recent Msys (e.g. htmlhelp.h provided by mingw-w64-i686-headers-git and
installed in /mingw32/i686-w64-mingw32/include/htmlhelp.h and the library by
mingw-w64-i686-crt-git in /mingw32/i686-w64-mingw32/lib/libhtmlhelp.a ; and
similarly for the 64 bit version in /mingw64/x86_64-w64-mingw32/...).

However, to generate the doc in chm format, it is necessary to install
Html Help Worshop (file htmlhelp.exe):
official : https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=14188
alternate: https://github.com/EWSoftware/SHFB/raw/master/ThirdPartyTools/htmlhelp.exe
PATH=$PATH:'/c/Program Files (x86)/HTML Help Workshop/'
