		General Compilation Information


This directory contains the source of GNU Prolog. 

1) Compiling locally
--------------------

To compile the package locally use:

   ./configure [OPTIONS]
   make


For more information about the options of configure refer to the INSTALL file in the parent directory. 

It is possible to re-run './configure' to change the value of some
installation directories (see 2) after the local compilation (i.e. the
compilation will not be done again).


2) Cleaning
-----------

To remove installed files (remove the content of INSTALL_DIR):

   make uninstall

To clean up the local compilation (does not erase configuration files):

   make clean

To fully clean up the local compilation:

   make distclean


2) Rebuilding a source distribution
-----------------------------------

   make dist

this will create a file gprolog-xxx.tgz (in the src directory).
