		GNU Prolog with Contexts (CxLP)

Should work in native-code compilation mode but emulated mode is not yet
supported (e.g. consult does not work).

Normally, gprolog-cx bootstraps correctly.
You should be able to build (and rebuild from itself) as for gprolog:
./configure
make
make check
make

The sub-compilers written in Prolog (pl2wam and fd2c) do not use contexts and
can be compiled with the classical gprolog's gplc. However, the builtins should be
compiled with the gprolog/cx version of pl2wam else you will obtain an unstable
(and unusable) system.

Things can thus become broken when mixing compilation with classical gprolog and gprolog/cx...

One symptom is that the following command never finishes:

fd2c FD_FILE

this is due to the clause in BipsPl/call.pl: context(X) :- context(X).
which is normally inlined by the cx version while it give rise to an 
infinite loop the non-cx version.

Another symptom is you obtain a lot of undefined symbol when trying to build pl2wam, e.g.
  "_pl_sys_var", referenced from:
      _Pl_Indomain_Alt_0 in libbips_fd.a(fd_values_c.o)
      _Pl_Stream_Get_Key in libbips_pl.a(stream_supp.o)
      _Pl_Stream_Getc in libbips_pl.a(stream_supp.o)
   ...

To fix this, we need 2 environments:
 - terminal 1 on the gprolog-cx to build
 - terminal 2 with environment on a classical gprolog

In terminal 1:
cd ~/gprolog-cx/src
. SETVARS
make distclean
make clean-wam
./configure

In terminal 2:
# setup the environment with PATH on the classical gprolog
cd ~/gprolog/src/
. SETVARS
# compile pl2wam/cw with the classical gprolog's gplc
cd ~/gprolog-cx/src/Pl2Wam
make


In terminal 1:
# complete the build of the context version
make
make check  # this one has differences (it is normal)
make check  # maybe this also has differences (it is normal)
make check  # this one should reach a fix-point and be OK
make

now you can continue to work on this terminal (you can close terminal 2)
in particular you can re-create it:

make clean
make
make check
make
