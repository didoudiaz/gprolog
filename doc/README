                            GNU-Prolog Documentation


1- Contents of this directory
-----------------------------

This directory contains the source of the manual written in LaTeX and several
target versions:

   - gprolog.dvi  (DVI version)
   - gprolog.pdf  (PDF version)
   - gprolog.ps   (PostScript version)
   - gprolog.html (HTML version entirely in one page)
   - gprolog.chm  (Compressed HTML used by MS HTMLHelp under Win32)

The html_node directory contains the HTML version in several pages (on per node)
(files index.html, gprolog*.html)

This manual is also available at http://www.gprolog.org/manual

By default, the installation procedure copies each version in a directory
INSTALL_DIR/doc (see file ../INSTALL for more details).



2- Rebuilding the manual
------------------------

Each version can be reconstructed using the Makefile (type 'make help' for
a brief summary of available targets). Be sure to have the following environment
before trying to rebuild the manual:

   - LaTeX2e (with standard packages) is needed to rebuild the DVI version.
   - dvips is needed to rebuild the PostScript version from the DVI.
   - pdflatex is needed to rebuild the PDF version.
   - HeVeA (version >= 1.06) is required to rebuild the HTML version.
     HeVeA can be obtained at http://pauillac.inria.fr/~maranget/hevea/
   - The HTML Help compiler is needed to rebuild the HTML Help version
     (see below).



3- The HTML Help Version
------------------------

Microsoft HTML Help (HH for short) is the standard help system for the Win32
platforms (replacing old WinHelp). It is mainly based on HTML files + add-ons
(table of contents, index, search facilities,...). A SDK is freely available
as a "HTML Help Workshop". To obtain more information and/or the workshop
consult:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/htmlhelp/html/vsconHH1Start.asp

To install the workshop consult the file src/WINDOWS.

The HH version of the manual is constructed from the HTML files
(html_node/index.html and html_node/gprolog*.html) using a HH project (.hhp) which
includes a HH table of contents (.hhc) and a HH index (.hhk). The .hhc and
.hhk files are constructed wih HeVeA with a script hh_do_hhc_hhk and 2 .tex files. 
The result is a compressed (or compiled) HTML file (.chm).

The user does not need the entire HTML Help Workshop to view a .chm, only a
runtime called "Help Viewer" is necessary. It is provided with recent
versions of windows (e.g Windows XP). Else a viewer can be downloaded (file:
HHUPD.EXE) from the same URL (also available in C:\Program Files\HTML Help
Workshop\REDIST).

The .chm version is used by the Win32 GUI Console of GNU Prolog.


HTML Help File Formats
----------------------

This information is get from:
http://parthe.lpthe.jussieu.fr/~zeitlin/wxWindows/docs/wxwin495.htm#helpformat


wxHTML library uses a reduced version of MS HTML Workshop format. Tex2RTF can 
produce these files when generating HTML, if you set htmlWorkshopFiles to true 
in your tex2rtf.ini file.
(See wxHtmlHelpController for help controller description.)
A book consists of three files: header file, contents file and index file. You 
can make a regular zip archive of these files, plus the HTML and any image 
files, for wxHTML (or helpview) to read; and the .zip file can optionally be 
renamed to .htb.
Header file (.hhp)
Header file must contain these lines (and may contain additional lines which are 
ignored) :
Contents file=<filename.hhc>
Index file=<filename.hhk>
Title=<title of your book>
Default topic=<default page to be displayed.htm>

All filenames (including the Default topic) are relative to the location of .hhp 
file.
Localization note: In addition, .hhp file may contain line
Charset=<rfc_charset>

which specifies what charset (e.g. "iso8859_1") was used in contents and index 
files. Please note that this line is incompatible with MS HTML Help Workshop and 
it would either silently remove it or complain with some error. See also Writing 
non-English applications.
Contents file (.hhc)
Contents file has HTML syntax and it can be parsed by regular HTML parser. It 
contains exactly one list (<ul>....</ul> statement):
<ul>

  <li> <object type="text/sitemap">
           <param name="Name" value="@topic name@">
           <param name="ID" value=@numeric_id@>
           <param name="Local" value="@filename.htm@">
       </object>
  <li> <object type="text/sitemap">
           <param name="Name" value="@topic name@">
           <param name="ID" value=@numeric_id@>
           <param name="Local" value="@filename.htm@">
       </object>
  ...    

</ul>

You can modify value attributes of param tags. topic name is name of 
chapter/topic as is displayed in contents, filename.htm is HTML page name 
(relative to .hhp file) and numeric_id is optional - it is used only when you 
use wxHtmlHelpController::Display(int)
Items in the list may be nested - one <li> statement may contain a <ul> 
sub-statement:
<ul>

  <li> <object type="text/sitemap">
           <param name="Name" value="Top node">
           <param name="Local" value="top.htm">
       </object>
       <ul>
         <li> <object type="text/sitemap">
              <param name="Name" value="subnode in topnode">
              <param name="Local" value="subnode1.htm">
              </object>
      ...
       </ul>
       
  <li> <object type="text/sitemap">
           <param name="Name" value="Another Top">
           <param name="Local" value="top2.htm">
       </object>
  ...    

</ul>

Index file (.hhk)
Index files have same format as contents file except that ID params are ignored.
